# MDC Nuxthub rendering bug repo

As described in the issue, there seems to be a bug when client side rendering Markdown content using the [`@nuxtjs/mdc`](https://github.com/nuxt-modules/mdc) module.

Rendering works fine in dev and on SSR, but during client side rendering, the content is not rendered.
