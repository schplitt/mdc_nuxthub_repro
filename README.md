# MDC Nuxthub rendering bug repo

As described in the issue, there seems to be a bug when client side rendering Markdown content using the `@nuxtjs/mdc` module.

Rendering works fine on the server side, but when navigating or refreshing the page, the content is not rendered.

You can  deploy this repo via this button to NuxtHub to see the issue in action:
